All games need the resources from "bytes_data.py". This code base is only for personal use for playing fun games with ChatGPT not for commercial use. ~80% of the code is generated by ChatGPT so there is no gaurantee that the code in this repo is working with no bugs. 

Please do not complain.

## How to play:

I didn't uploaded the compiled executable because they are too big and won't work on all the OS.

Try compiling the source main python file with pyinstaller yourself so that it works for any OS. For example for game 1 run
```
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller fighters.py --onefile --noconsole
```
from your terminal/ CMD.

Play the executable from ./dist directory.

Enjoy,
