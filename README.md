All games need the resources from "bytes_data.py". This code base is only for personal use for fun games not for commercial use. ~80% of the code is generated by ChatGPT so there is no gaurantee that the code in this repo is working with no bugs. 

Game 1 fighter jet: 
```
bytes_data.py
fighters.py
```
Game 2 (WIP) horizontal fighters:
```
horizontal.py
```
## How to play:

Compile the main python file with pyinstaller. For example for game 1 run
```
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller fighters.py --onefile --noconsole
```
from your terminal/ CMD.

Find the executable from ./dist directory.

I didn't uploaded the compiled executable because they are too big.
